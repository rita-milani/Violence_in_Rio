## Violence in Rio de Janeiro
In this project, we are going to work with a database containing series about violence in the state and city of Rio de Janeiro. The data was obtained from ISP Dados, organized by the Institute of Public Security from Rio de Janeiro. The database contains series about theft, homicide, kidnap and others from 1991 to 2020, and due to the size, we are going to select specific variables to work with.

As part of DSNP course, the aim of this project is to learn how to manipulate data in Pandas library, executing basic commands that are easily used in Excel, but require further coding skills in Python, like:

Replace blank cells for NaN
Convert data type
Aggregate columns
Drop columns
Work with selected sets of rows and columns
Build pivot tables to aggregate monthly to yearly data
Work with percentual change
Plot data
